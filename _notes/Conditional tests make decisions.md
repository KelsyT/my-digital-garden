title: Conditional tests make decisions
---

Expressions that are evaluated to determine whether an[[if statements| if statement]] is `True` or `False` are known as *conditional tests*. These examine an exact set of conditions and decide which action to take using [[bool|boolean values]]. A set of symbols called [[operators]] can be used to ask mathematical questions in Python.
