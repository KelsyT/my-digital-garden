The video is about a technique called "Time Blocking," where the creator explains a method for managing and organizing tasks using Google Calendar. The technique involves categorizing tasks and events into different tiers of priority and flexibility, which are represented by different colored calendars. The creator suggests five tiers: Appointments, Bottlenecks, Critical, Daily Routine, and Dream Self. 

Each tier represents different levels of importance and flexibility: 

1. **Appointments**: A - BRIGHT RED - These are tasks that must be done at specific times and cannot be easily rescheduled. They are represented in bright red and include events like doctor's appointments, meetings, and flights. 

2. **Bottlenecks**: B - BRIGHT PURPLE - These are tasks or events that are critical to other important things in your life, even if they are not tied to a specific time. They are represented in a slightly less intense color and serve as precursors to more significant goals. 

3. **Critical**: C - BRIGHT PINK - These tasks are essential to your main priorities or goals. They are represented in a bright color, similar to Bottlenecks. These tasks may be habits or activities critical to your success. 

4. **Daily Routine**: D - NUETRAL TONE - These are the tasks you do daily to maintain your routine, including blocking time for sleep. They are represented in a regular color, and the creator suggests "graying out" completed tasks as a way of tracking your progress. 

5. **Dream Self**: F - NEUTRAL YELLOW - This tier represents tasks that your ideal self would do, even though they are not crucial to your day-to-day operations. They are more flexible and can be deleted if they don't get completed. 

6. **Default/Named Calendar**: BLACK - This is for capturing tasks quickly off the top of the head without sorting into one of the other tiers.
