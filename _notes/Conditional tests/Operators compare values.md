---

Operators compare values in a [[Conditional tests make decisions|conditional test]].

From CS50P:

-   Built within Python are a set of “operators” that are used to ask mathematical questions.
-   `>` and `<` symbols are probably quite familiar to you.
-   `>=` denotes “greater than or equal to.”
-   `<=` denotes “less than or equal to.”
-   `==` denotes “equals, though do notice the double equal sign! A single equal sign would assign a value. Double equal signs are used to compare variables."
-   `!=` denotes "not equal to"
-   Conditional statements compare a left-hand term to a right-hand term.
