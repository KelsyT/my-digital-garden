title: Conditional tests make decisions
---

Expressions that are evaluated to determine whether an[[if statements execute when true| if statement]] is `True` or `False` are known as *conditional tests*. These examine an exact set of conditions and decide which action to take using [[bool|boolean values]]. A set of symbols called [[Operators compare values|operators]] can be used for comparison, such as `==` for "equal to".

```python
>>> car = 'bmw'
>>> car == 'bmw'
True
```
